# 2.3 - BoseEinsteinCondensate tutorial: 3D BoseEinsteinCondensate in a comoving frame

We now want to take the step into 3D. This is not to different from the 2D systems.  We start by setting the potential to a gaussian and initialise the wave function by relaxing the Thomas-Fermi ground state.

```python

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import comfit as cf

### task 1. Initialise a BoseEinsteinCondensate in 3 dimensions with resolution 64x64x64. Sett gamma = 0 and dt =0.1


### task 2. set the potential to a gaussian placed at the centre with size = 2 and strenght = 4. Initialise the
# wave function using the thomas-fermi groundstate and relax the system for 100 time steps. Plot the result
