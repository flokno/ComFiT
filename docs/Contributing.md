# Contributing to ComFiT

We welcome contributions.
Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving our documentation, your support helps us make the package more robust and versatile.

## How to Contribute

Contributions can take many forms, from fixing minor bugs to implementing complex new features. Below are the ways you can contribute:

### Bug Fixes

Did you identify a bug? Here's how to proceed:

1. **Fork the repository**: Start by forking the ComFiT GitHub repository.
2. **Create a branch**: Make a new branch on your fork dedicated to the bug fix.
3. **Fix the bug**: Make the necessary changes to resolve the bug.
4. **Run tests**: Ensure all existing tests pass with your changes. Add new tests if necessary to cover the bug fix.
5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Create a PR against the main ComFiT repository. Clearly describe the bug and how your changes fix it.

### Reporting Issues

Encountered an issue or have a suggestion? Please follow these steps:

1. **Check existing issues**: Before creating a new issue, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. **Create a new issue**: If your issue is unique, open a new issue on GitHub. Provide a detailed description, including steps to reproduce the issue if applicable.

### Feature Requests

Got an idea for a new feature or enhancement? We'd love to hear it! Please raise a discussion, or an issue as outlined above, detailing your idea and its potential benefits to ComFiT.

### Adding Your Own Model

If you're interested in adding your own model to ComFiT, we welcome your contribution! Your model should adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Well-documented**: Include detailed documentation explaining your model's theory, implementation, and usage.
2. **Thoroughly tested**: Write comprehensive tests covering the functionality of your model.
3. **Follow ComFiT structure**: Ensure your model integrates seamlessly with the existing ComFiT framework.
4. **Tutorial**: Consider adding a tutorial in the form of a Jupyter notebook, demonstrating how to use your model. Link to the tutorial in your contribution.

For detailed instructions on implementing your own PDE model with ComFiT, refer to our [tutorial for creating your own model](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vidarsko/ComFiT/blob/main/tutorial/base_system_make_your_own_model.ipynb).

### Documentation Improvements

Good documentation is key to a project's usability and its community's growth. 
If you see areas for improvement or want to add documentation for undocumented features, your contributions are greatly appreciated.
