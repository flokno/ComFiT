# Topological defects

Topological defects are defects that appear due to imposed constraints by boundary conditions[^merminTopologicalTheoryDefects1979].

In this work, we will track topological defects as course entities derivable from the primary field of observation[^skogvollUnifiedFieldTheory2023].

## Topological defects in a Bose Einstein Condensate

In order to get a sense of what topological defects are, we will look at how they emerge in a Bose-Einstein condensate.
As simulated in the class BoseEinsteinCondensate, the BEC i represented by a complex function $\psi$, which has a specific modulus $\psi_0$ in equilibrium.

The equilibrium condition of $|\psi|=\psi_0$ does not, however, determine the phase $\theta \equiv arg(\psi)$ of $\psi$.
Thus the all states with psi0 are equilibrium states.
The possible equilibrium values of $\theta$ define the _ground state manifold_ $\mathcal M$.
