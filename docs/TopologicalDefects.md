# Topological defects

Topological defects are defects that appear due to imposed constraints by boundary conditions[^merminTopologicalTheoryDefects1979].

In this work, we will track topological defects as course entities derivable from the primary field of observation[^skogvollUnifiedFieldTheory2023].
