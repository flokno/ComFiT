# ComFiT: Computational Field Theory Python Package

ComFiT is a Python library designed for simulating various condensed matter field theory systems. Developed with expertise from PhD-level research in physics, this package aims to provide a comprehensive toolkit for researchers, students, and enthusiasts in the domain.

## Features

- **General System Definition**: Utilize the `define_system` superclass to establish general properties of systems.
- **Model-specific Simulations**: Dive deep with subclasses like `PFC` for phase-field crystal simulations and `BEC` for Bose-Einstein condensate simulations via the Gross-Pitaevski equation.
- **Extendable Framework**: Easily expand with your own models and simulations.

## Installation

```bash
pip install comfit
```

## Usage

```python
from comfit import PFC, BEC

# Define a PFC system and simulate
pfc_system = PFC(parameters_here)
pfc_system.simulate()

# Define a BEC system and simulate
bec_system = BEC(parameters_here)
bec_system.simulate()
```
